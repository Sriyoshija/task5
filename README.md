Heart Disease Prediction System                                                                                                                                         

This repository contains a complete implementation of decision tree and random forest classifiers for predicting heart disease risk using the Heart Disease dataset. This demonstrates machine learning workflows including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization, and interpretation.                                                    

**Key Features:**

1. End-to-end ML pipeline from data loading to model evaluation
2. decision tree visualization
3. Overfitting analysis with depth tuning
4. Comparative performance evaluation (accuracy + cross-validation)
5. Feature importance interpretation for both models
6. Comprehensive visual analytics (4 diagnostic plots)
